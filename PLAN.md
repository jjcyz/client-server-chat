# Chat Application Optimization Plan

## Goal
Optimize the chat application to support 50 concurrent users with stable performance.

## Current Architecture
- Server: 8 worker threads
- Message queue: 2000 messages
- Connection pool: 200 slots
- Non-blocking sockets with kqueue
- Client timeout: 15 seconds

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Baseline Testing (50 Users)
- [x] Reduce stress test to 50 concurrent users
- [ ] Test and document baseline performance

### Phase 2: Message Batching
- [ ] Implement message collection over short time window
- [ ] Modify broadcast mechanism to send batches
- [ ] Test and measure performance improvement

### Phase 3: Connection Pooling
- [ ] Implement connection pool management
- [ ] Add connection reuse logic
- [ ] Test connection stability

### Phase 4: Rate Limiting
- [ ] Implement basic rate limiting per user
- [ ] Add message prioritization
- [ ] Test under various load conditions

### Phase 5: Optimization
- [ ] Fine-tune message queue size
- [ ] Optimize worker thread count
- [ ] Implement performance monitoring

## Performance Metrics to Track
1. Message delivery latency
2. Connection success rate
3. Message throughput
4. Resource usage (CPU, memory)
5. Error rates

## Success Criteria
- Stable support for 50 concurrent users
- Message delivery latency < 100ms
- Connection success rate > 99%
- No message loss under normal load
- Resource usage within acceptable limits
