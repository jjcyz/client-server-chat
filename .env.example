# Client-Server Chat Application
# Environment Variables Configuration
# ============================================

# ============================================
# Frontend Configuration (Next.js)
# ============================================
# These variables are used by the frontend application
# Place these in frontend/.env.local for Next.js to pick them up

# WebSocket URL for connecting to the chat server
# Default: ws://localhost:8080 (connects to websocket-bridge)
# For production, set this to your deployed WebSocket server URL
# Example: NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://your-domain.com:8080
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080

# Demo Mode Toggle
# Set to "true" to enable demo mode (works without backend)
# Set to "false" to disable demo mode
# If not set, demo mode auto-activates in production when NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL is not configured
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=false

# ============================================
# WebSocket Bridge Configuration
# ============================================
# Note: Currently hardcoded in websocket-bridge/index.js
# These are documented here for reference. To make them configurable,
# you would need to update the bridge to read from environment variables.
#
# WS_PORT=8080          # WebSocket server port
# TCP_HOST=127.0.0.1    # C++ server host
# TCP_PORT=5555         # C++ server port

# ============================================
# C++ Server Configuration
# ============================================
# Note: Currently hardcoded in include/constants.h
# These are documented here for reference. To make them configurable,
# you would need to update the C++ server to read from environment variables.
#
# PORT=5555                    # Server listening port
# MAX_CONNECTIONS=200          # Maximum concurrent connections
# CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=30        # Connection timeout in seconds
# MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE=4096        # Maximum message size in bytes
# MESSAGE_QUEUE_SIZE=2000      # Message queue size
# MAX_HISTORY_SIZE=1000        # Chat history size
# WORKER_THREADS=4             # Number of worker threads

# ============================================
# Usage Instructions
# ============================================
# 1. Copy this file to create your local .env file:
#    cp .env.example .env
#
# 2. For Next.js frontend, create frontend/.env.local:
#    cd frontend
#    cp ../.env.example .env.local
#    # Edit .env.local and uncomment/modify the NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables
#
# 3. For local development with backend:
#    - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:8080
#    - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=false
#
# 4. For frontend-only development (no backend):
#    - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE=true
#    - NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL can be omitted
#
# 5. For production deployment:
#    - Set NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL to your production WebSocket URL
#    - Omit NEXT_PUBLIC_DEMO_MODE (or set to false)
